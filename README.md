# pixi-socketio-ts-webpack-boilerplate

Ultimate multiplayer game: PixiJs, Socketio, Typescript, Webpack and Jest (although I'm still a noob how to write tests). Gives INSTANT feedback and can automatically fix your code.

## Quickstart

1. install essential components
   -  git bash
   -  nodeJS
   -  yarn
   -  npm install -g typescript
2. `git clone https://github.com/FloodGames/pixi-socketio-ts-webpack-boilerplate`
3. `yarn install`
4. `yarn server`

## Recommended VSCode extensions:

material icon theme

-  ESLint _(to have VSCode tell you how ugly your code is)_
-  IntelliCode _(like your phone autocomplete but for your code)_
-  TS/JS postfix completion _(some cool shortcuts and templates)_
-  Git Graph _(turns vscode into a mean git machine)_
-  IP Address _(shows your local ip address making it easy to share what you are testing in a lan environment like an office.)_

## Production Build

yarn build
yarn dist //to run the production build locally
